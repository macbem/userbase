# UserBase

This app is another form of learning Elixir for me.

Functions:
- using an external library (Poison) to handle JSON inputs/outputs
- get user input describing a User object and create a struct from it
- show available users
- show user by his id
- zip/unzip the users directory to make the user base transferrable
